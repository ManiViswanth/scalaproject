   on the other hand, containing the same exception as the Failure[A]

   If you chain multiple map operations, this will result in a nested Try structure,
   which is usually not what you want.

   The flatMap method on a Try[A] expects to be passed a function that receives an A
   and returns a Try[B]. If our Try[A] instance is already a Failure[A],

   simply passing along the wrapped exception along the chain. I
   f our Try[A] is a Success[A], flatMap unpacks the A value in it
   and maps it to a Try[B] by passing this value to the mapping function.

  This means that we can basically create a pipeline of operations
  that require the values carried over in Success instances
  by chaining an arbitrary number of flatMap calls
